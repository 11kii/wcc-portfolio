    <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Shuyi Huang, and I am a master's student majoring in Computational Art at Goldsmiths, University of London. My passion for art and technology has led me to explore the fascinating world of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and their potential to revolutionize the way we perceive and create art.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an artist, I strive to harness the power of AI and machine learning to create innovative and thought-provoking pieces that challenge traditional artistic boundaries. My work seeks to investigate the intersection between human creativity and the capabilities of advanced technologies, pushing the limits of what is possible in the realm of art.
    </p>
    <p>
        My artistic journey has taken me through a diverse range of mediums and techniques, allowing me to develop a unique and evolving portfolio that reflects my ongoing exploration of computational art. I am committed to not only deepening my understanding of the artistic applications of AI and machine learning but also sharing my passion and discoveries with the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Inspired by the endless possibilities that technology offers, I continue to push myself as an artist, aiming to create compelling and impactful works that can inspire others to think beyond the traditional boundaries of art.
